This blog is used to capture my thoughts and learnings in life. My thoughts will definitely change as time goes on, but this is what I think at this current point in time.
{{< /alert >}}

## Introduction

This is the beginning of my personal blog website made in Hugo which I will use to do the following:
1. Record the recipes I have cooked for my own leisure and so I can reflect upon how I have progressed.
2. Document technical software engineering and general engineering concepts as a means of reinforcing my technical understanding of certain concepts.
3. Note down my thoughts on certain philosophical/socialogical concepts. These are less into intellectual schools of thought of what is real, but more a discussion on what makes a good life, how society should be structured for the greater good of all things (humans, environment, animals and more...).

Since I am a rookie to markdown, this is also a great oppurtunity to learn more about how to document in markdown as I create this.

## Who am I?
In one sentence: An Engineer who likes cooking, thinking about how to solve the worlds problems and interested in technology.
### Educational background
I am a mechatronics engineering graduate turned into a software engineer due to software being one of the areas in which the most room for growth in the current situation of technology related to robotics. After working in software engineering doing stuff related to backend hardware on mission criticl systems, I have developed an interest in computer science more. The topics of interest are related to the performance of code, writing code that is secure from a cyber security point of view, but also from a safety point of view (things should not go wrong, if they do, there should be measures in place).

### Cooking
I am an avid cook outside of work so I am fortunate enough to be able to turn a necessary chore into personal leisure. I cook a wide range of dishes such Italian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Thai cuisine with many more to come. 

Cooking for me is a way to disconnect from the computer/phone screen and use my hands to craft something physical rather than virtual (code). I believe there is a link to the mind and body when crafting something physical which comes with a unique sense of satisfaction. Cooking also has a side benefit of being a good way to connect with the culture of the food as I can often read more about the history of certain dishes when researching the recipe.

Another benefit of cooking I love is that cooking the food myself provides me with an understanding of what goes into the meal I make at a restaurant. It provides me with a stronger appreciation of the work that went into the dish I ordered and the people who made it.

### Philosophy and society
I also like to think deeply about philosophical and societal issues. My personality type is one in which I am always looking at problems and how we can solve them. To me it is okay to make mistakes, but those mistakes are wasted if do not act on them to improve things. Mistakes are important data our brain's feedback loop (engineering students should like this analogy). The problems I like to focus on are the following:
1. What makes a good life? How should humans aspire to coexist with all things on this earth?
2. Individuality vs Collectivism? Having different ways of thinking is what makes us human, but adhering to collective norms is what keeps society going. 
3. Growth vs Stability? In the capitalistic world most of us live in, growth is the motivating factor. However, everything is finite. For companies and certain individuals to grow in power, wealth and influence, something or someone has to give. For example, the environment, money, submission of power or even life itself.
4. Are we humans more important than the rest of the world? Or is it our responisibility to preserve it? As the most powerful living specicies on this earth thanks to technology, I feel like it should be on humans to be responsible for preserving the natural world of the animals and nature we extract resources from. Without them, there is no us.
5. How can we structure society where the measures of success are aligned with protecting the environment and bettering the lives of all things?

I am sure I will have many more topics to discuss in the future. I will continue to add this to my about me page. 

### Motivating factors in technology

Undoubtley, most of the growth in software engineering in this current day and age is in web technologies. The full-stack technologies comprising of a front-end and back-end. In order to keep up with this side of software engineering, I need to learn more about web technologies.

I do not see myself being a front-end engineer in the future. Even still, it is good to be aware of how the front-end interacts with the backend via HTTP requests and responses. 
I believe my focus should be on understanding more about the backend technologies and understand the similarities and differences with software development in more mission critical hardware development applications. 

In fact, I reckon in the future, these areas will be integrated much more (I am sure they are already being integrated somewhere). The real question is whether the web-based systems will be required to be designed, assured and certified to the same standard as software running on mission critial hardware in the future.
